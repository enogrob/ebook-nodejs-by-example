# Nodejs by Example

![ebook_cover](images/nodejs-by-example.png)

**About**

`Node.js` is a JavaScript-driven technology, which means that developers can use the same language to write backend code. Its growing community and the large amount of available modules make `Node.js` one of the most attractive development environments.

`Node.js` By Example covers `Node.js` fundamentals and teaches you how to use its technology to architect a project. It shows you how to manage an application's assets and how to implement the Model-View-Controller pattern. The next few chapters demonstrate how to develop the features of your social network. It also empowers you to communicate with a database, including storing, retrieving, and deleting data. The book ends by discussing the most popular ways to test your user interface in an efficient way.
